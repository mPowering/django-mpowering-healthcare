            <p>The long overdue Android 4.1 update for the HTC One X is finally here. Users in Asia,
Europe and South America are reporting that the update is available for unlocked HTC
One X phones (CID_038 & CID_044). From what we can gather, the Android 4.1 update
with HTC Sense 4+ is being pushed out in two separate parts: a smaller 1.25-1.6 MB
file followed by the main 357-364 MB Android 4.1 update.
If you’re not sure which HTC One X you have, you can easily check by downloading a
CID app from Google Play. If you have not already received the OTA update notification,
you can try to manually ping HTC’s update servers by going to Settings > About >
Software updates >Check now.</p>
