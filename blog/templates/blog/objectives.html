<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build the capacity of governments, organizations and individuals to harness the power of mobile technology to strengthen maternal and child health services delivered by frontline health workers.
</li>
<li>
Support the scale up of mHealth applications for frontline health workers through country-based multi-stakeholder coalitions in priority countries.
</li>
<li>
Generate evidence and information on the use of mobile technology by frontline health workers to mobilize resources and improve the design of mHealth applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Areas of Activity </h2>
mPowering Frontline Health Workers is undertaking three key areas of activity to fulfill these objectives: 
<h2>Global Tools</h2>
Developing an online Content Library and Digital Dictionary:

<ul>
<li><strong>Content Library:</strong> The partnership will create an online repository of digital health content (e.g. SMS, IVR, video, audio, images, animation) that can be downloaded and integrated into technology applications by mobile operators, NGOs, social enterprises, health training institutions and governments to improve the effectiveness of hundreds of thousands of health workers around the world.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Digital dictionary:</strong> The partnership will create content standards using a 'digital dictionary' to improve integration across multiple mHealth applications, to reduce duplicated efforts, and to facilitate interoperability and comparability across a variety of technologies, languages and formats. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Global Tools Task Force is leading the effort in advising on crowdsourcing content and the development of global tools to support organizations implementing mHealth programs for frontline health workers. A landscape assessment has been undertaken which outlines options for the development of an online digital content repository/ marketplace using a cloud-based platform. A strategic workshop was held in December 2012 to review the findings of a consultation with mHealth experts and health practitioners and to select the preferred model for the online platform. In the summer of 2013 a consultant was appointed to support development of the content strategy for the online platform through a second series of stakeholder interviews and a survey of 20 organizations’ health content.

             <h2>Country Programs</h2>
             <p>
mPowering Frontline Health Workers will support the scale‐up of programs using mobile technology in at least three countries; we will develop sustainable models for localizing and delivering content‐based mHealth applications for frontline health workers through partnerships with the public, NGO and private sectors. 
</p>
<p>
Country programs will test and validate the content and standards developed through this partnership, and catalyze multi‐stakeholder coalitions to support the development of sustainable financing and operational models needed to deploy and sustain mHealth for frontline health workers at scale. mPowering Frontline Health Workers will support scale up of successful prototypes/pilots where there is a healthy enabling environment, including leadership from local governments and strong support from the corporate sector, mobile operators and other key stakeholders. In the case of new programs, countries will build for scale by integrating the content and standards developed under this partnership with the appropriate mHealth tools and technology required for large‐scale deployment. The Country Program Task Force provided thought leadership on the prioritization and selection of the mPowering countries: India, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda. The task force will be helping to develop mPowering’s country program strategy and advise on country engagement activities going forward.

<h2>Research and Evaluation</h2>
<p>
The Research and Evaluation component of the partnership will build the evidence base for mHealth applications for frontline health workers; evidence will be used to support advocacy efforts to mobilize resources from funders, investors and governments and to help improve the design of future mHealth initiatives. 
The partnership will invest in monitoring and evaluation of all partnership activity areas and will share experiences and impact through an online global learning platform, social media, peer‐reviewed research journals, and presentations at national and international conferences. The Research and Evaluation Task Force is leading the activities to build the evidence base for mHealth interventions.
