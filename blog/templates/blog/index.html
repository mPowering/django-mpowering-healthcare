            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <div class="row-fluid">
                <p>Frontline health workers are the first and often the only link to health care for millions of families in low and middle income countries. Mobile technology, nearly ubiquitous in these countries, offers a revolutionary opportunity to strengthen the capacity of frontline health workers and expand the coverage of critical maternal and child health interventions such as antenatal services, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, essential newborn care, immunization, and early detection and treatment of diarrhea, malaria, and pneumonia.</p>

                <p>To harness the power of mobile technology at scale, USAID has joined forces with public and private sector partners to form a three-year partnership called mPowering Frontline Health Workers.  This innovative partnership is designed to improve maternal and child health by accelerating the use of mobile technology by frontline health workers around the world.  The founding partners are USAID, UNICEF, Qualcomm, Vodafone, Intel, MDG Health Alliance, GlaxoSmithKline, Praekelt Foundation, Frontline Health Workers Coalition, and Absolute Return for Kids.   The mHealth Alliance serves as the partnership secretariat, connecting the partnership activities to the broader global and mHealth communities. The USAID-funded MCHIP project provides technical assistance and is also responsible for financial and human resources management and administration.</p>

            <h2><strong>Global</strong> Tools</h2>	
            <p>The Global Tools Task Force advises on the development and dissemination of tools, multimedia digital health content, open standards and training materials to support organizations implementing mHealth programs for frontline health workers. The task force will also develop a strategy to accelerate the scale-up of social enterprises offering mHealth products and services for health workers. The task force is co-chaired by iHeed and the Open Concept Lab.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>Activity:</strong> The task force has completed a landscape assessment that outlines options for the development of an online digital content repository/ marketplace. A strategic workshop was held in December 2012 to review the landscape findings and select a preferred model for the online platform.</p>

            <h2>Country <strong>Program</strong></h2>
            <p>The Country Program Task Force advises on the development of country plans for targeted technical assistance to support the scale-up of existing mHealth initiatives. Targeted technical assistance may include policy support, operations research, evaluation, implementation support, business modeling, stakeholder engagement, documentation, and/or catalytic funding for the development of evidence-based prototype applications. The task force is co-chaired by UNICEF, Absolute Return for Kids and the MDG Health Alliance.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>Activity:</strong> Using criteria including partner resources, mobile penetration and government support, the task force has selected focus countries: India, Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique. </p>

            <p> The Research and Evaluation Task Force advises on a strategy to build the evidence base on the use of mHealth to improve performance and accountability of frontline health workers. The task force will develop tools to help governments, managers and funders make evidence-based decisions on the use of mobile technology to improve the quality, efficiency and coverage of health interventions. The task force is co-chaired by the Johns Hopkins University Global mHealth Initiative and Vital Wave Consulting.</p>
           <p>
            <strong>Activity:</strong> The task force has drafted a theory of change and a set of focal questions that will inform both the partnership and global mHealth research agendas.</p>

The task force is co-chaired by GlaxoSmithKline and the Praekelt Foundation.</p>
           <p>
            <strong>Activity:</strong> The task force has developed a draft communications strategy with key audiences, messages and communications channels. In support of this task force, the Praekelt Foundation has created a partnership website, an animated video, a logo, presentation templates and a social media strategy. </p>
