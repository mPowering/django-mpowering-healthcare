The Campaign builds upon the successful advocacy and awareness efforts of the global community over the past years, in the name of the Millennium Development Goals, to mobilize financial and technical advisory for the upgrade and expansion of national CHW programs. CHWs, particularly when enabled with mobile technologies, are a crucial delivery mechanism for expanding the reach of primary healthcare systems, making them the strategic solution to reducing morbidity and averting mortality in mothers, newborns and children. The Campaign is operated by a small secretariat based in New York with field staff in Africa, and has engaged 10 countries in its first year - with more to come!
